						</header>
                        <p>Rhiza Research is a nonprofit that seeks out data, technology, and
                        technical capacity gaps and develops creative, open, and accessible technical solutions
                        to fill those gaps. We are dedicated to working on projects that we believe will
                        have a positive impact on the well-being of ecosystems and communities, from
                        electric grids to weather forecasting, from ecology to music.</p>

                                <h4>Power EQuality</h4>
                                <p>Over the past decades, sweeping efforts have been made to ensure global access to electricity.
                                However, in much of the world even those with access to electricity still receive electricity
                                with poor reliability and quality. This lack of quality undermines the proposed benefits of
                                electrification in homes, businesses, schools and hospitals and also makes it much more difficult for utilities
                                to transition their grids to cleaner energy.</p>

                                <p>The Power EQuality project aims to highlight and act on the global disparity of access to
								high-quality
								electricity. The project is building
                                a community around the problem, hosting a series of lectures and directly working to create a
                                power quality analysis toolkit to increase the accessibility and impact of power quality measurement
                                worldwide. We will roll out an open-source power quality
                                measurement device, release a library of high-resolution, standards compliant power
                                quality data, and work with manufacturers to
                                integrate measurement capabilities into existing grid-connected devices like smart meters and inverters.</p>

									<h4>Project Nimbus</h4>
									<p>Weather intelligence&mdash;the use short, medium, and long-term forecasts for improved decision-making in critical sectors including agriculture and energy&mdash;is increasingly vital in the face of unprecedented changes in weather and climate. However, the availability of localized, high-quality forecasts is not equitable around the world; regions that are unable to make large investments in specialized measurement equipment or computational resources suffer from disparities in forecast quality, actionability, and usability. Project Nimbus aims to address global inequity in weather intelligence. Leveraging strong partnerships in Kenya, and funded by the Gates Foundation, Project Nimbus will provide innovative technical solutions to improve weather intelligence in East Africa, with a focus on providing actionable insights for small holder farmers.
